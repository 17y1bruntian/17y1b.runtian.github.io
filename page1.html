<h1> Description </h1>
<p> Before the early 19th century, most of the main island of Singapore was covered with primary forest. Soon after the British established a settlement in Singapore in 1819 and commercial activity took root, there was a demand for fresh water. However, it was decades before the settlement's first fresh water supply was established.</p>

<p> Between 1820 and 1870, a substantial portion of the virgin forest was cleared to assist Singapore in becoming an important trading post. Prior to this, Chinese planters had also worked the forested land for timber and the cultivation of crops like gambier, pepper and rubber [rubber was not planted commercially in Singapore before 
the 20th century]. By 1886, only 10% of the original forest cover remained. </p>
